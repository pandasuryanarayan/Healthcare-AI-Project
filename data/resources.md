## [IoMT-2024-Attack-Classification-and-Explainability-Using-XGBoost](https://github.com/yashprakashh/IoMT-2024-Attack-Classification-and-Explainability-Using-XGBoost)
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to classify cyberattacks on Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices using the CIC IoMT 2024 dataset. The workflow involves training an XGBoost model for multiclass classification and utilizing SHAP and LIME for model interpretability.

## [Maternal-Risk-Prediction-System](https://github.com/Kundana-Y/Maternal-Risk-Prediction-System)
This project addresses the challenge of precise maternal risk prediction using data from Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices in the field of maternal health. The approach involves exploring the IoMT-derived dataset and using feature selection to identify critical devices for maternal risk prediction.

## [GLM_final-project](https://github.com/WEIMY666/GLM_final-project)
SPECT is an instrument for functional and metabolic imaging in vivo with the help of a single photon nuclide labeled drug. With advances in radiation medicine, doctors can use certain features of SPECT images to determine whether a personâ€™s heart is healthy or not. Based on those features, we try to separate abnormal patients from healthy patients. Dimension reduction and feature selection play essential roles in these mass-spectrometric data with high-dimensional features. Classification models, based on feature selection techniques, are applied to the SPECT heart dataset. Precision accuracy are considered finally to compare different methods, and ensemble method is used to improve the model.
